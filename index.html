1) High Order Component in react js ?<br>
Soln:
      HOC takes component as a input and pass component as output.
      one component that taking another component as props and return component. takes component as input and pass as a output.
      Higher Order Components or HOC is the advanced method of reusing the component functionality logic.
       It simply takes the original component and return the Enhanced component.

       takes comp and return new comp. pattern that derived from react component nature. we called them new compo. we cant modify data that we have passed.
      
       Reasons: 
         easy to handle.
        get rid of copying the same logic in every component.
         Makes code more Readable.<hr>

2) Do you know about SEO ? Is it true that react js supports SEO support ?<br>
soln:
      SEO stands for Search engine OPtimizer.
      React JS has simply code structure that is the advantage for SEO.
      React helps build a very user-friendly UI that is also valuable by SEO. 
      so you definitely shouldn't avoid it while creating a user interface for your app/website. 
      However, you should use some tricks in your React-site is understandable for Google crawlers and, therefore, good for SEO.
      React JS as well as angular & vue helps the developer to create a great user experience which is positive for SEO.
      avoid traffic in our website<hr> 

3) clean up in useEffect ?<br>
Soln:
       React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts.
       The useEffect hook is built in a way that if we return a function within the method, it gets executed when the component unmounts.
       React would execute the cleanup functions after return and then update the screen.
       It is similar to the behavior of componentWillUnmount in classes.
       we are using this because to remove unwanted & unnecessary data and it's prevents the memory leaks.<hr>

4) What is the use of useCallback and useMemo <br>
Soln:
       useCallback Hook:-
         The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
        Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
         The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
         This can improve performance. 

         The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.<hr>

       useMemo Hook:-
           The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
           The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value.
           The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.<hr>

5) Why do we need keys in react less?<br>
Soln:
       The main purpose of keys is to help React differentiate and distinguish elements from each other.
       increasing its performance when diffing between the virtual and real DOM.
       To use keys, simply add the prop inside an element such as <li>.<hr>

6) Do you know about redux ?<br>
Soln:
       Redux is a container where you can store your whole application data.
       so we are call it state management tool.
       It doesn't belong to the component.
       Redux is state management library, i.e. open source JS library.
       Its makes complex Application Easier.
       It provides centralized store that component can access data directly.
      It is Flexible can works with any UI framework/Library.
       component/action creators -> Action --> dispatch --> Reducers -- > Info store Central store --> Subcription --> pass state
